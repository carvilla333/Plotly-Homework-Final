# Plotly-Homework-Final

In this assignment, we built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset

Below are the steps listed that were needed for the completion of this assignment:

1. Use the D3 library to read in samples.json.
2. Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
3. Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
4. Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
5. Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.
6. Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.
